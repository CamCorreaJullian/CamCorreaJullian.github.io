My name is Camila Correa-Jullian, I am a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at University of California, Los Angeles. My current research at the Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences is focused on identifying operational risks of autonomous vehicles employed for mobility as a service. My previous research has focused on the application of Machine Learning techniques for Prognosis and Health Management of renewable energy systems, such as solar thermal and solar PV, and risk assessments of hydrogen fueling station infrastructure and liquid hydrogen storage systems.
