**Abstract**

Liquid hydrogen (LH2) storage systems are fundamental components of Hydrogen Refueling Station (HRS) designs. Like gaseous hydrogen (GH2) storage-based stations, the need for data to support development of risk-informed codes and standards is a known remaining challenge that is limiting technology deployment. Quantifying the risk of unintended LH2 releases, as well as the effect of cryogenic temperatures on infrastructure and instrumentation, is of critical importance to address reliability and safety questions. A first step toward characterizing LH2 system-related risk scenarios is the identification of relevant failure modes. One means for doing this is through the development of a Failure Analysis and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Hence, in this study we apply the FMEA process to a generic liquid hydrogen storage design to identify liquid hydrogen-related failure modes and to qualitatively assess probability and severity classes. Based on this analysis, the failure scenarios which represent the highest risk of liquid hydrogen releases are: malfunction of the pressure relief valve system in the liquid storage tank, failure of the air-operated valve between the storage tank and the cryogenic pump, and rupture of the evaporator due to collision or external accident. To further extend the work, we identify data requirements which must be considered to enable quantitative risk assessment (QRA) on these systems. Additionally, failure detection methods are discussed for possible extension to methods involving early failure detection and prognosis capabilities
