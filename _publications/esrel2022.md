**Abstract**

System risk analysis and safety assessments of Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS) have mostly focused on aspects of the vehicle's functionality, performance, and interactions with other road users under various driving scenarios. However, as the deployment of ADS becomes more common, the importance of addressing risks arising from fleet management operations is critical, such as the role of fleet operators in the context of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). In this work, we present a system breakdown of ADS remote operations and discuss the role and participation of fleet operators as separate entities from ADS developers. Selected high-level accident scenarios are analyzed, focused on collision events caused by the ADS vehicle operating in unsafe conditions and failed interventions by remote fleet management centers. In particular, key roles of the fleet operator identified include periodically performing inspection and maintenance procedures and acting as a safety barrier for MRC mechanisms limitations.
