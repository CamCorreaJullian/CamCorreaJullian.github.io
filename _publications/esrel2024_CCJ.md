**Abstract**

Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are expected to play a significant role in the transportation environment in the coming decades, either deployed for passenger transport or as features in privately-owned vehicles. In both cases, humans will continue interacting with these systems as drivers, operators, and/or fellow road users. An element defining the current levels of driving automation is the task division and allocation between the human and the autonomous agent while operating under specific conditions. In this context, takeover and handover events, i.e., control transitions that can be triggered by exceeding the specified operational conditions, have become a focus of interest in multiple safety, reliability, and human factors research. This work discusses the high-level tasks human and autonomous agents perform in ADS operations. Three cases of interest are defined based on their relation to the ADS-equipped vehicle: a remote operator, a safety driver, and a consumerlevel driver. This definition is based on which agent is responsible for high-level tasks, such as monitoring, planning, and executing the Dynamic Driving Tasks. A new taxonomy for control transitions and interventions is proposed for the three use cases. This taxonomy considers who initiated the control transition, who is in control after the transitions, the context that triggers the event, and whether it is a success or failure. Including successful or failed states in the taxonomy is relevant to address potential hazard scenarios and develop appropriate safety mechanisms to prevent or mitigate their risk.

Keywords: automated driving systems, control transitions, takeover and handover, task allocation
