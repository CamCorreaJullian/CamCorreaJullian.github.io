**Abstract**

Automated driving technologies are becoming increasingly common across various applications in the transportation industry. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in expanding these applications towards commercial heavy-duty operations, aiming to increase operational hours and reduce fatal collisions. Currently, multiple companies are involved in the development, testing, and small-scale deployment of heavy-duty automated vehicle (HD-AV) systems. With the emergence of new Automated Driving System (ADS) technology additional risks are introduced to commercial fleet operations. Currently, HD-AV fleet operations are planned as a joint effort of multiple human and machine agents, including an onboard safety driver and a fleet operations center. HD-AV operations can potentially cover a range of applications, including middlemile, drayage, long-haul, etc. each with distinct operational profiles and safety requirements. In each of these, the interactions between agents contribute to the complexity of the operations and the design of safety requirements. Most notable among these are the interactions between the safety driver and the ADS, and these interactions must be modelled to construct an in-depth safety analysis. This work presents a discussion of current ADS and human-related safety metrics and suggests potential metrics that can build upon these to assess human-ADS interactions.

Keywords: automated driving systems, control transitions, takeover and handover, task allocation
