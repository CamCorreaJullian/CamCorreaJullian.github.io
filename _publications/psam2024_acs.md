**Abstract**

The use of automated driving technology in heavy-duty vehicles for commercial freight operations aims to increase efficiency and operational hours, as well as reduce traffic incidents. While there are currently over twenty companies actively developing HD-AV systems in the United States, the regulatory framework needed to implement these systems at a commercial level must address the unique safety risks that Automated Driving System (ADS) technology introduces. Potential HD-AV operations envision a team of human and machine agents, including the ADS, an onboard safety driver, a fleet operations centre, and, in some cases, an onboard safety operator. The complex interactions between these human and machine agents must be addressed when determining the systemâ€™s safety requirements and design. Safety metrics usually focus on ADS performance, but to adequately inform system design and safety requirements, these metrics must also focus on human-system interactions. The data gleaned from these metrics can lead to improvements in the human-machine interface (HMI), warnings and alerts, and task allocation between the safety drivers and ADS. This work proposes an approach to derive human-system interaction safety metrics based on Concurrent Task Analysis (CoTA), a method built to study human and automated system interactions from a task decomposition and success-oriented analysis perspective. The CoTA method, based on the Information, Decision and Action (IDA) cognitive model, is used to model the tasks performed by different agents and study the interactions between them. In turn, this can inform procedure development, identify contributing task errors and propagation mechanisms, and identify the critical tasks needed for success of a system. This work uses CoTA to identify the most critical tasks of safety drivers in an HD-AV operation, and with this information discusses safety-related human-system interaction metrics to inform HD-AV system development.
