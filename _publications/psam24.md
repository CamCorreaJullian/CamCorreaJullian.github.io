**Abstract**

Autonomous systems and automated technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent across multiple industries and applications, such as aviation and air traffic control, marine transportation, and railway industries. In many of these complex systems, human operator teams frequently focus on monitoring and supervising the system’s operation, acting as a safety barrier in emergencies. The need to study Human-Autonomy Team’s (HAT’s) performance in the case of automation failure and limited decision-making explainability may become more important as interactions between humans and machine agents diversify to non-expert systems. This is the case for drivers on board vehicles equipped with highly Automated Driving Systems (ADS). This work explores the applicability of Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs) used in Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) models to the HATs present in ADS operations. This work identifies potential factors influencing the performance of both human and automated agents in ADS operations to apply team performance models such as the Information, Decision and Action in Crew (IDAC) context. This work focuses on the relationship, tasks, and challenges drivers face when interacting with vehicles equipped with advanced ADS. It highlights the role that individual, system, team, and scenario-related factors play in the overall system's safety.

Keywords: human-autonomy teams, automated driving systems, performance shaping/influencing factors
