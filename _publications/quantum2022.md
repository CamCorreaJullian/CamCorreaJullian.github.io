Driven by the development of machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques, prognostics and health management (PHM) has become a key aspect of reliability engineering research. With the recent rise in popularity of quantum computing algorithms and public availability of first-generation quantum hardware, it is of interest to assess their potential for efficiently handling large quantities of operational data for PHM purposes. This paper addresses the application of quantum kernel classification models for fault detection in wind turbine systems (WTSs). The analyzed data correspond to low-frequency SCADA sensor measurements and recorded SCADA alarm logs, focused on the early detection of pitch fault failures. This work aims to explore potential advantages of quantum kernel methods, such as quantum support vector machines (Q-SVMs), over traditional ML approaches and compare principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders (AE) as feature reduction tools. Results show that the proposed quantum approach is comparable to conventional ML models in terms of performance and can outperform traditional models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors) for the selected reduced dimensionality of 19 features for both PCA and AE. The overall highest mean accuracies obtained are 0.945 for Gaussian SVM and 0.925 for Q-SVM models.
