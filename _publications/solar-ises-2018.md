**Abstract**

The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of a single effect hot water-fired Water/LiBr absorption chiller that supplies the cooling demands in the dairy industry sector in Chile. The high levels of radiation of the Chilean center regions enhance solar absorption as a viable alternative to electrically driven mechanical vapor compression systems. Different plant configurations were simulated with TRNSYS 18 for a designed cooling fraction covered by the absorption chiller in a range of 14 % to 20 %. Areas of a solar field between 80-230 m2 of evacuated tube collectors coupled with an auxiliary gas system provided heat for the absorption system. The results showed a solar fraction for the studied cooling system of values between 30 % to 66 % and COPs between 0.40 to 0.51. A LCOC varying from 0.164 to 0.22 USD/kWh was obtained. The configurations of solar absorption system for the different studied collector´s area obtain a negative NPV. However, a reduction in the collector´s prices, different storage capacities or different system configurations may improve the results of the economic study.
