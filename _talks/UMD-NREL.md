About
======
This presentation is part of the Virtual NREL Technical Seminars given during 2020. This talk refers to the work developed between NREL and UMD regarding hydrogen systems: Risk and reliability analysis are critical to the development of safe systems, designing maintenance strategies, and creating codes and standards. We are exploring the suitability of modern tools for risk assessment, such as QRA (Quantitative Risk Assessment), and reliability analysis, such as PHM (Prognosis and Health Management), in hydrogen systems. Both have the potential to close knowledge gaps from different perspectives and enable H2 infrastructure deployment. This technical meeting will address common data requirements for QRA and PHM in hydrogen systems, with a focus on identifying data sources with potential to enable research to close gaps for LH2 systems. Topical Discussion Points: 1. QRA data needs: Component failure and event frequency data on hydrogen systems and components. 2. PHM data needs: Condition-monitoring data-based methods to explore PHM-informed risk-mitigation measures. 3. Engage with researchers with hydrogen stakeholders for collaboration and data sharing.
