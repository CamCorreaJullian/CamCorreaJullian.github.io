The aim of this work is to identify and quantify the effects of solar energy integration in
Chile's manufacturing industry. From a public database, annual fuel and electricity
consumption of different sectors are extracted, and effective thermal and cooling demand is
estimated. Analyzing geographical availability of solar radiation, key areas have been
identified in the food industry for possible integration of solar thermal technology. The
potential savings due to the replacement of petroleum derivatives in the meat, fruit and
vegetable, dairy and wine sub-sectors amounts to 638.629 MWh (USD 26.500 million),
while the replacement of electricity for refrigeration in bakery and dairy products, meat and
wine sector is estimated in 156,199 MWh (USD 18.600 million).
KEYWORDS: Solar heat for industrial processes, solar heat integration potential,
suitable industrial sector and processes, Chile.
